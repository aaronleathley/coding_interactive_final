          <p>Even before running for office, Mayor Tom Butt had a vision for how Richmond should be built. When he moved to the city from Marin County in 1973, he opened an architecture firm specializing in historic preservation, and over the years has had a hand in rebuilding and preserving many of Richmond’s numerous historic sites – the Hotel Mac, the East Brother Lighthouse and the SS Red Oak Victory warship, among others. His firm has sought 21 building permits for projects in Richmond since his election as mayor in 2015.</p>

          <p>Butt’s involvement in real estate development in Richmond has created many opportunities for conflicts of interest to arise since he entered public office as a City Council member in 1996. As a council member, and for the past six years as mayor, development projects that Butt’s architecture firm has worked on have come before the City Council many times. Since becoming mayor in 2016, Butt has recused himself from council proceedings 29 times due to conflicts of interest. During his career in office, he has sought written advice from California’s political ethics board, the Fair Political Practices Commission, five times.</p>

          <p>Three lawsuits — including one filed by a business partner — accuse Butt of working behind the scenes to inappropriately steer controversial development decisions about three large swaths of undeveloped land in Richmond. One of the suits involves a decision that benefitted a client of Butt’s architectural firm, another has the potential to result in more business for the firm.</p>
            
          <p>One of the properties is on Richmond’s north shoreline. Another is Point Molate. The third, at the center of the most recent lawsuit, is the former Zeneca, Inc. industrial site, on the city’s south shore.</p>

          <p>In two interviews, Butt said he routinely seeks legal advice from the city attorney and the Fair Political Practices Commission when an issue before council touches on his personal business. And he denied any suggestion that he has used his elected position to bring more business to his firm. On the contrary, he said, his firm has lost money from his involvement in politics because, to avoid a conflict of interest, he hasn’t bid on many city projects.</p>
        
          <p>“I don’t make money when development comes to Richmond. I only make money when my architectural firm takes on a project,” Butt said in an October interview.</p>
        
          <p>One of the lawsuits was filed by attorney Joshua Genser, with whom Butt is in joint ventures to manage two historic properties. Genser contends Butt pushed for a decision that benefitted the mayor’s firm while adversely affecting Genser’s property. And he claims the mayor violated ethics laws in the process.</p>
            
          <p>“He tried all kinds of clever things to make it so that we couldn’t develop the property, but it wouldn’t technically be a [government] taking,” Genser said. “And you know, he’s a very smart guy.”</p>
            
          <p>When Butt moved to Richmond from Marin County in the 1970s, he carried his family’s history of service with him. His grandfather was an Arkansas state senator and the mayor of Eureka Springs, a small city in the Ozark Mountains. His father was the longest-serving judge in Arkansas. Butt’s service started with the military in Vietnam, where he served with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. And the tradition carried into the next generation. One of Butt’s two sons has served on Richmond commissions, as have Butt’s wife and daughter-in-law. Each member of the family is trained in architecture or city planning. Mayor Butt is also closely involved in Richmond’s business and real estate community.</p>
            
          <p>Butt’s sons Andrew and Daniel say they too must manage the ethical questions that accompany their family’s involvement in business and politics. Andrew — who served on Richmond’s Design Review Board and Planning Commission for a total of 10 years — also is a principal in the family’s firm, Interactive Resources. Andrew Butt recused himself eight times due to business conflicts during his stint as a planning commissioner — including on a decision that his then-council member father proceeded to vote on. Daniel Butt, an attorney and property broker, has periodically appeared before bodies his family members oversee on behalf of clients of his law firm, his brokerage firm and his construction company.</p>
            
          <p>Mayor Butt says that over the years, he’s closely followed the law governing when politicians must recuse themselves from decisions in which they hold a financial stake. “Generally it’s kind of black and white. You’re either involved or you’re not involved [in a project before city government],” Butt said in the October interview.</p>
            
          <p>“I really try to play it straight. And you know – it is a complicated area. And I try to get the best advice I can,” he said.</p>
            
          <p>Running into business-related conflicts of interest is not uncommon for local politicians, who are not required to divest from their private ventures in the same way that their state– and national–level counterparts are. It typically shouldn’t be difficult for local officials to address these situations ethically, said John Pelissero, an expert in government ethics with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.</p>
            
          <p>“It’s only a tense issue when you have someone who just seems to be entangled [to the extent that it’s difficult] for them to be able to act in doing the public’s business without raising some question about their own potential conflicts,” Pelissero said.</p>
            
          <p>Local politicians also have an ethical duty to avoid even the appearance of conflicts, Pelissero said. “The other question is, are they acting in ways to demonstrate that they take that obligation seriously, and they’re not even putting themselves in a position where it appears that they might have a conflict of interest,” he said.</p>

          <p>Genser and Butt were business partners before they were friends. They first met over a real estate proposition: Butt suggested that they go in together on the development of a modest historic storefront in Point Richmond, Genser said. After developing that property together in the late 1990s, their business partnership grew, and they became friends. The two sometimes took fishing trips to Genser’s cabin, and their businesses — Genser’s law office, and Butt’s architecture-engineering firm — eventually shared an address, in another historic Point Richmond office building that Butt leased in part to his friend.</p>

          <p>In 2010, that friendship unraveled. It began when Butt, by then a member of City Council, announced his support for a decision that would bar Genser and his business partners from building on a sweeping plot of shoreline property they owned in north Richmond. The group had been holding onto the property for years, searching for the best — and most profitable — development for it. But environmental groups were actively pushing against any large development of the property.</p>

          <p>Genser was at the council meeting in which Butt announced his support for downzoning the tract to parkland as part of an update to Richmond’s General Plan. That zoning designation would effectively keep any significant construction from occurring there. Genser said he was shocked.</p>

          <p>“He’s a business person,” Genser said. “You would think he’d recognize the importance of an investment, you know, not just to the investors but to the city.”</p>
            
          <p>Genser sued Butt and the city in 2017, claiming the mayor used inappropriate, private communications with another council member to ensure the downzoning, in violation of California’s Political Reform Act.</p>
            
          <p>Butt’s first attempt to downzone the land began with his surprising announcement supporting parkland zoning at the meeting Genser attended in January 2010, and his subsequent motion that February to downzone the land, Genser’s lawsuit claims. Though the motion failed to pass, the city included a proposal to zone Genser’s property as parkland in its new General Plan shortly thereafter. Seeing that, Genser challenged the ethicality of Butt’s involvement in decisions about the property and demanded that he recuse himself. Butt took the question to the Fair Political Practices Commission, in a June 8, 2011 letter. And Genser’s attorneys responded with their own letter arguing that Butt’s participation would be unethical.</p>

          <p>While FPPC complaints about public officials usually arise from concerns that they might use their office to further their own or their partners’ interests, Genser had the opposite concern. He feared that despite their partnership, Butt would use his office to steer a decision that could slash the value of Genser’s property by millions of dollars. In a 2011 letter to Butt, the FPPC unequivocally agreed that under the Political Reform Act, Butt couldn’t participate in – or communicate with other officials about – any decision regarding Genser’s land, regardless of whether that decision would help or hurt Genser’s bottom line.</p>
            
          <p>With Genser’s attorneys now involved, the Planning Department decided to compromise with the property owners. It agreed to create a light industrial zoning category that would allow them to build a profitable project, while keeping construction to a minimum. The City Council voted in early 2012 to apply the new zoning category to Genser’s land, with Butt recusing himself from the vote.</p>
            
          <p>Yet in 2016, the lawsuit claims, when Butt saw another opportunity to pass an ordinance that would downzone Genser’s property, he took it — despite the FPPC’s bar on his participation. According to the lawsuit, Butt defied the FPPC’s advice and pushed from behind the scenes for legislation that would halt the landowners’ efforts to develop the property and would give it a zoning designation that would effectively bar any profitable use of the land except for the cultivation of cannabis.</p>
            
          <p>That would eliminate a huge swath of potential projects that Genser’s land could attract. It would also benefit the mayor financially, the suit claims, because Interactive Resources had taken on a client who was a cannabis developer.</p>
            
          <p>In an April interview, Butt said he believed the conflict of interest he had was erased when Genser moved out of the space he had rented in one of their jointly managed properties. The two still jointly manage several Point Richmond properties, Butt said.</p>
            
          <p>“When Genser moved out and ceased to be a tenant, you know, that relationship was no longer there. And so...I concluded that I no longer had the same conflict of interest the FPPC advised me about earlier,” Butt said.</p>
            
          <p>The cannabis developer, Richard Trieber, had approached Genser and the other landowners in late 2015 or early 2016, Genser said. Trieber was an entrepreneurial jack-of-all-trades from Marin County and had envisioned building a revolutionary business campus for cannabis growers on Genser’s land. It would sport 59 greenhouses equipped with the necessary appliances for growing high-quality cannabis. Growers would just have to bring their plants, sign a lease and get started. The project would be called PowerPlant Park.</p>
            
            
          <p>To Andrew Butt — the mayor’s son and the lead architect on the project — Trieber’s proposal seemed like a timely opportunity. Cannabis was transitioning into a legitimate industry: Medical marijuana cultivation was already allowed in Richmond, and California voters would soon vote to decriminalize recreational cannabis at the state level. A legalized cannabis industry would present new building frontiers for architects and engineers, and Trieber’s proposal was on the cutting edge. If properly designed, PowerPlant Park could be the most professional, state-of-the-art grow facility in the state, if not the country, Andrew Butt said in a recent interview.</p>
            
          <p>“We wanted to ride the green wave too,” he added.</p>
            
          <p>PowerPlant Park also came with financial incentives for the city. In addition to the 400 jobs developers claimed would come with the completed campus, the city would levy its 5% cannabis business tax on the development, and collect tens of thousands of dollars on top of that in fees.</p>

          <p>By late 2016, Genser saw his plans for the land eroding. After candidates backed by the Richmond Progressive Alliance won a majority on the City Council in November of that year, Genser knew a vote to downzone the property would soon follow.</p>
            
            
          <p>Genser believed from the parkland supporters’ discussion of his property over the years that cannabis was the one profitable venture they would accept there. So although he didn’t want to gamble on a cannabis project on his property, a zoning change would make him see it as his only option if he wanted significant returns on his investment.</p>

          <p>“There’s no question we feel pushed into it,” Genser said. “It was the path of least resistance.”</p>
            
          <p>Interactive Resources began working with Trieber to design PowerPlant Park on Sept. 7, 2016, Andrew Butt said in an April email. According to the Genser lawsuit, Mayor Butt exchanged at least 10 emails with council member Gayle McLaughlin from Dec. 12, 2016 to February 13, 2017, all from his private email account. In them, the lawsuit claims, they discussed how best to conduct the downzoning effort, with the mayor counseling McLaughlin on key steps in the process of introducing an ordinance.</p>
            
          <p>First, he urged her to introduce the zoning ordinance quickly to the newly seated council, whose progressive majority was likely to support any zoning change that would bar industrial projects like those Genser had originally hoped to build on the land.</p>
            
          <p>“You would have to move fast before any of these projects gets vested. I suggest January 17,” Butt wrote in a Dec. 12, 2016, email filed as an exhibit in the lawsuit.</p>
            
          <p>Then, the lawsuit says, Butt recommended introducing a moratorium that would immediately halt all proposals for projects on the land — including industrial projects submitted by several of Genser’s co-owners of the parcel who hadn’t yet agreed to lease their portions of it to Trieber. And McLaughlin asked if it was possible to halt project proposals that hadn’t yet been reviewed by the city’s design board, as was the case with the industrial proposal. “I think so, but that’s a legal question,” Mayor Butt wrote back in a Jan. 18, 2017, email cited in the lawsuit. “Maybe do it and sort out the legal issues later.”</p>
            
          <p>The moratorium required six votes to pass, and with Butt recusing himself, all remaining council members would have to vote in its favor. Then-council member Ben Choi was concerned that because his employer, the electricity provider Marin Clean Energy, was in a contract to buy power from a partner on the PowerPlant Park project, he would have a conflict of interest on any vote involving the north Richmond property. Butt – who is a member of Marin Clean Energy’s board – disagreed.</p>
            
          <p>“That’s no no conflict for him because he has no financial interest in it,” Butt wrote to McLaughlin in a Jan. 21, 2017, email included in the lawsuit. “He should talk to me of [sic] the MCE counsel,” he added.</p>
            
          <p>McLaughlin also twice suggested they speak about the zoning issue over the phone, the emails show. She also suggested meeting in person to discuss it in a Feb. 13, 2017 email, to which Butt responded, “yes, okay.”</p>
            
          <p>In late January, McLaughlin introduced a resolution directing city staff to start downzoning the Northshore land for agricultural use. (The resolution mirrored the one Butt had proposed 2010, McLaughlin noted at a council meeting). The council passed it unanimously on Jan. 24. Two weeks later, it also passed McLaughlin’s proposals to halt the progress of the landowner’s development applications, and to allow cannabis cultivation in agricultural zones.</p>
            
          <p>McLaughlin said she knew when Butt first emailed her that he would have to recuse himself from the decisions they were discussing, but that the responsibility of ensuring his actions – and communications – fell on the right side of political ethics laws was ultimately up to him.</p>
            
          <p>“It’s up to him to recuse himself, and it’s up to him to know what he can email, or what he can’t email,” McLaughlin said. “The person who has the potential conflict of interest is the person that is responsible for determining and finding out what they can do and what they can’t do,” she added.</p>
            
          <p>“He emailed me, ‘maybe you want to put this on the agenda,’ and I thought, oh, that’s a good idea, I care about this issue,” she said. McLaughlin also said she had no idea about PowerPlant Park or Interactive Resources’ involvement in it at that time.</p>
            
          <p>Butt maintains that he was also unaware of his architecture firm’s relationship with PowerPlant Park when he contacted McLaughlin.</p>
            
          <p>“After Genser moved out, I conclude any conflict I had was erased. However, I was not aware that others at Interactive Resources had begun a business relationship with the owners of PowerPlant partners. I was not aware of that when I emailed McLaughlin,” Butt said in a recent email.</p>
            
          <p>Asked why, if he thought the conflict no longer existed, he recused himself from the downsizing vote, Butt said in a recent email, “I had been recusing myself for so long, I just kept doing it without thinking that circumstances had changed.”</p>
            
          <p>The unanimous and little-debated passage of the moratorium and zoning ordinances prompted Genser’s attorneys to make a public records request for Butt’s emails. In December 2017, Genser filed the lawsuit in Contra Costa County Superior Court.</p>    
            
          <p>In their legal response, attorneys for the city argued that even if Butt had violated the Political Reform Act, it didn’t affect the integrity of the council’s decisions on the ordinances.</p>
            
          <p>“Plaintiffs do not and cannot allege that any of the City Council members who voted on the moratorium stated on the record or otherwise that their decision to vote for the Ordinances was influenced by Mayor Butt...In other words, even if there was a violation, it was minor, and in no manner infected the integrity of the public process,” the response said.</p>
            
          <p>A judge then ordered the city to stop efforts to rezone Genser’s land while the litigation was ongoing. But Genser had a change of heart and decided to cut his losses, pause his expensive legal battle, and hope that PowerPlant Park would be as profitable as Trieber promised. The judge dismissed the lawsuit in November 2018.</p>
            
          <p>A year later, Genser signed a lease with Trieber, effectively betting the profitability of the land on the future success of PowerPlant Park.</p>
            
          <p>In October 2019, Butt cast a vote that further paved the way for PowerPlant Park: Along with the rest of the City Council, he voted to allow the use and sale of recreational cannabis in Richmond. Until then, only medical marijuana had been allowed. Opening the recreational cannabis market would open up the rental market for PowerPlant Park’s grow spaces.</p>
            
          <p>“We cannot succeed as an operation without adding adult cannabis to our program,” said Larry Westland, a property broker formerly involved in the PowerPlant Park project, at that October council meeting.</p>
            
          <p>Though not mentioned in the lawsuit, the recreational cannabis vote again found Butt operating at the limits of what political ethics laws allow. Despite his obvious financial interest in the vote, Butt was free to participate due to the “Public Generally” exception in California law. Under it, officials are allowed to participate in decisions in which they have a financial stake if the impact it will have on their interests is indistinguishable from the impact it will have on a broad section of the public. The recreational cannabis vote would certainly impact others in the cannabis industry.</p>
            
          <p>The mayor and his son took different approaches when given an opportunity to vote on the city’s recreational marijuana policy. Andrew Butt recused himself due to his interest in PowerPlant Park when the question came before the Planning Commission in April 2019. Mayor Butt, on the other hand, voted for it when it came to the City Council six months later.</p>
            
          <p>“If it had been something that was specific to that ... project, like a [conditional use permit] or something like that, I think it’s pretty clear I would have had a conflict, and I would not have participated in that,” Mayor Butt said in a recent interview.</p>
            
          <p>PowerPlant Park has yet to materialize. No construction beyond grading has been done on Genser’s land, and Genser says he is owed rent. Andrew Butt said Trieber owes Interactive Resources $140,000 for design work.</p>
            
          <p>Trieber was unavailable for comment.</p>
            
          <p>What’s more, if the project falls apart, Genser has said he may revive his lawsuit, which Richmond has spent more than $400,000 to defend. It would likely further claims made in the original suit that Richmond’s city government effectively seized Genser’s land by essentially zoning it exclusively for cannabis, which remains illegal under federal law.</p>
            
          <p>Genser and Butt still co-manage several properties, and Butt said he still considers Genser a friend. But Genser sees it differently. “We’re civil to each other,” he said. “ I see him at Rotary, or I used to...we still are business partners. But, you know – still angry at him.”</p>

          <p>Butt is also facing claims that he circumvented laws aimed at ensuring government transparency in order to push a controversial development through the city’s approval process. The second suit alleges he did so to lock the city into an unpopular development plan for a highly contested and potentially lucrative shoreline property — Point Molate.</p>

          <p>Embedded in Point Molate’s landscape are several features that make it difficult and controversial to develop. Home to a ship fueling depot before the Navy bequeathed it to the city in 2003, the land is contaminated with toxic substances such as lead and asbestos. At the same time, portions of the point contain burial sites claimed by the Ohlone Native American tribe, as well as relatively undisturbed swaths of shoreline habitat – increasingly rare as the beach encircling the San Francisco Bay vanishes under developments. The area lies about 10 minutes northwest of Chevron’s Richmond refinery and holds a century-old complex of 35 buildings that once housed one of the world’s largest wineries.</p>

          <p>Given these constraints, what – and how much – to build at Point Molate has been arguably the most contentious issue in Richmond politics for nearly two decades. The biggest flashpoint is the question of housing. While supporters say a housing development would ease pressure on the housing market in Richmond and in the greater Bay Area, and could include affordable-rate homes, opponents argue that building homes on land so close to the Chevron refinery, and with so few roads, would almost certainly endanger residents’ lives in the event of a fire. They also argue that any homes built there are unlikely to be truly accessible to low-income people, and that most of the land should be preserved as open space.</p>
          
          <p>Point Molate – and particularly its historic district – has been a focus of Mayor Butt’s for years, said Andrew Butt, adding that his father has been drawn to the site since he arrived in the 1970s.</p>
            
          <p>“One of the things he’s always been really passionate about is historic preservation, and that’s...the whole thing out there is a historic district that’s sitting there, you know, literally falling apart,” Andrew Butt said.</p>
            
          <p>But Mayor Butt’s vision of a revived historic district on Point Molate is antithetical to what open space advocates want because it would require building, Andrew Butt said.</p>
            
          <p>“One of the things that’s also really important to him I know [is] to have housing out there,” he said. “It recreates what was out there historically, which is a living, breathing community.”</p>
          
          <p>Andrew Butt said his father has worked for decades to see his vision of Point Molate come to fruition. “I think it is kind of a legacy project for him,” he said.</p>
            
          <p>In 2003, Richmond signed an agreement with developer James Levine to build a casino at Point Molate that would then be sold to the Guidiville Rancheria of California, a Pomo Native American tribe. It seemed the city would see a new project there. But as Levine’s company, called Upstream, sought approvals from the federal government, environmental groups sued it in federal court, claiming the company and the city hadn’t met state environmental protection rules. A 2010 settlement brought about more environmental protections.</p>
            
          <p>Two years later, the project was back in court. Upstream was unable to clinch federal approvals, prompting the city to withdraw its support. Levine and the tribe responded by suing Richmond, saying it had broken their development deal.</p>
            
          <p>Throughout Butt’s first term as mayor, he made ending the lawsuit and starting development at Point Molate top priorities: His 2017 and 2018 State of the City presentations highlighted “take back Point Molate and start developing it” and “settle Point Molate litigation” as goals for the year.</p>
            
          <p>But as Butt’s first term neared its end in 2018, the lawsuit was on the road to trial, and tensions between community organizers and the city over Point Molate were at fever pitch. In mediation sessions and closed session council meetings, Butt and the City Council pushed through a development plan for Point Molate, violating open-meetings laws in the process, the latest lawsuit – filed by two environmental groups – claims.</p>

          <p>“Richmond’s Mayor and City Council, in unannounced serial meeting and in closed session, violated California’s open meeting ‘Brown Act,’...when they approved specific land development, purported to settle litigation over development of Point Molate,” the two groups said in a petition to the court.</p>
            
          <p>The plan set a deadline for the city to sell or lease the property, and required any developer that bought it to construct 670 housing units and restore all of the roughly 375,000 square feet of historic buildings there. The deal would be lucrative for Upstream and the tribe, which would get 50% of net revenues from the sale or lease of the property.</p>
            
          <p>The City Council agreed on the deal at some point during the settlement conference and closed session meetings that took place between Jan. 26, 2018, and March 20, 2018, the lawsuit says. The issue was settled when a federal judge signed off on the deal in April 2018. This effectively made the development plan enforceable in court.</p>
            
          <p>Yet the deal still faced one seemingly insurmountable obstacle. Under Richmond ordinance, the settlement had to be passed by a majority of the seven-member City Council. The relentless community opposition to any housing on Point Molate meant it was unlikely that three council members would publicly side with the mayor and support the deal, said Norman La Force, an attorney and the CEO of one of the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit.</p>
            
          <p>“We believe – I believe, and others too – that Mayor Butt was concerned that he would not get at least four votes to vote for the settlement agreement if it had to be disclosed publicly,” said La Force in an interview. “So he hid it. He hid it. Which is against the law.”</p>
            
          <p>Led by Butt, the City Council voted in favor of the settlement deal in one of the closed session meetings, the lawsuit contends. Under California law, the lawsuit says, that vote was illegal: Passing settlement deals in closed sessions is almost never allowed, and city councils can’t make land use decisions in closed sessions either, the suit claims. The vote count — and any changes of heart by council members who had opposed housing on Point Molate publicly — remained secret.</p>
            
          <p>In its legal response, the city said the closed session meetings were allowed because they fell within an exception the Brown Act makes for meetings about settling litigation.</p>
            
          <p>The settlement deal passed, and the City Council announced it publicly during an open session at its April 17, 2018, meeting. Community organizers who had fought the plan were outraged. A month later, the two environmental groups sued the city, Butt, and the City Council.</p>
            
          <p>In a 2019 online post, Butt called the environmental groups’ Brown Act claims “bogus.”</p>
            
          <p>More than a year after disclosing the deal, the city sought an updated agreement from Upstream, the Native American tribe and the court. The city hoped the amended deal, which a judge approved in November 2019, would hasten the end of the environmental groups’ lawsuit, according to a report staff sent the City Council about the agreement. The amended judgment was almost identical to the original, with an important difference: a disclaimer that the deal “does not grant any entitlements for development at Point Molate.”</p>
            
          <p>“Even though they say, ‘Oh no, those aren’t really entitlements – well, I’m sorry, they are. Just because you call something a monkey doesn’t make it something that it’s not,” said Stuart Flashman, the attorney for the environmental groups.</p>
            
          <p>The mayor scheduled a vote on the amended judgment in the City Council’s open session on Nov. 5. It was one of the most contentious sessions Richmond had seen. Among the 23 members of the public who signed up to testify on the vote was the former mayor of Berkeley, Shirley Dean.</p>
            
          <p>“You made a private land use decision that closed off the public. Pure and simple, that’s against the law,” Dean said.</p>
            
          <p>At one point, the mayor tried to order the shouting audience to leave the council chambers. The deal passed on a 4-3 vote, with Nathaniel Bates, Demnlus Johnson and Ben Choi joining Butt’s affirmative vote. Other than Butt, only Choi had been on the council when the original deal came up in closed session.</p>
            
          <p>A year later, the city sold the Point Molate project to the Southern California-based developer Suncal, which in turn agreed to sell its historic district, including the winery, to Bay Area-based developer Orton Development.</p>
            
          <p>If Suncal and Orton do break ground on Point Molate, there’s no legal barrier to their hiring Interactive Resources — one of only two architecture businesses in Richmond, and the only one in the city specializing in historic preservation — to rehabilitate its historic district.</p>
            
          <p>In the October interview, Mayor Butt said, “I have no economic interest in Point Molate. Never have.”</p>
            
          <p>Andrew Butt said in a recent interview that the firm has not been hired for work on Point Molate, and could not consider it as long as the property was owned by the city. But if circumstances changed, the firm could consider it.</p>
            
          <p>“Let’s say I’m running the firm, and my dad’s not involved any more, and I’m not in any political position with Richmond and that conflict’s not there, would I entertain doing [that] work? Absolutely,” he said.</p>
            
          <p>Asked if, under that scenario, he too would entertain the work, Mayor Butt said only, “No.”</p>
            
          <p>Last December, a judge dismissed the environmental groups’ lawsuit.</p>
            
          <p>When asked in an email about the lawsuit’s claims regarding his and the council’s conduct, Mayor Butt said only, “This lawsuit was decided in the City’s favor at trial court, but the petitioners have appealed it.”</p>
            
          <p>Flashman, the attorney for the environmental groups, has confirmed that they are appealing the decision. But the progressive-majority City Council seated in 2020 is unlikely to support aggressive defense of a new lawsuit. At the same time, if the city were to abandon its agreement to sell Point Molate to Suncal and Orton Development, the two companies could sue Richmond themselves.</p>

          <p>In December, new claims that Butt used his office to steer a development decision on another controversial property were filed in court.</p>
            
          <p>This time, the property was the former Zeneca Inc. industrial site on Richmond’s south shoreline. The multitude of chemicals left in the soil and water at the 90-acre site as a result of decades of manufacturing means the site rivals Point Molate as a lightning rod for conflict between environmental groups and supporters of development.</p>
            
          <p>In 2019, the Southern California-based developer Shopoff Realty Investments proposed a mixed-use project featuring 4,000 housing units and 50,000 square feet of retail space on the site. Led by Butt, the City Council scheduled a vote on a development agreement with Shopoff for early December, said Flashman, who represents the five environmental groups that filed the latest lawsuit.</p>
            
          <p>That meant that although a new City Council that was unlikely to support the deal had been elected in November, it wouldn’t get to vote on the agreement because it would not be sworn in until January.</p>
            
          <p>“I think that the mayor really wanted to get this done while he still had a council majority. ...I think he pushed this through as fast as he could,” Flashman said.</p>
            
          <p>The lawsuit claims that Butt used his position as mayor to cut off council members’ attempts to ask questions about the development agreement and the environmental impacts of the proposed project.</p>
            
          <p>Butt disputes that claim. “I did not cut anyone off, unless they exceeded their time limit,” he said in a recent email.</p>
            
          <p>Attorneys for the city have not yet filed a response to the lawsuit.</p>
            
          <p>With a lawsuit against the Point Molate project on appeal and the possibility that the owners of the PowerPlant cannabis growing site will reopen their case against the city, Richmomnd may be looking at a period of prolonged litigation. Whether Butt instigated any of that litigation will be up to the courts to decide.</p>
